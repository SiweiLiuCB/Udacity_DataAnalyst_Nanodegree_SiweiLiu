    "After having the final cleaned data frame, the first thing that I was interested in this data set was about the rating. What is the mean rating of dogs? What is the highest rating? And who is the dog that got the highest rating? I used '.describe()' on the 'rating_numerator' column, and found that the mean rating of dogs is 11.73 and 75% of dog ratings are above 12. The highest rating is a bit surprising, it's 1776! That is way bigger than most of the ratings. My curiosity drove me to explore who got this rating and what is going on. So I picked the tweet and after having a look at its text and its picture, I suddenly realized why it was rated 1776."

    "The tweet text of the above picture is 'This is Atticus. He's quite simply American af. 1776/10'. American flag, American flag style decoration, and 1776! 1776 was the year that the United States of America emerged as an independent country! That is why Atticus got such an first-sight-abnormal rating!  "

    "From the picture, it seems that there is a strong positive correaltion between retweets and favorites. I also calculated the correlation coefficient to make sure that the strong correlation does exist. I used Numpy's 'corrcoef' function and the result shows that the correlation between retweet and favorite is 0.917, which is a pretty strong positive correlation. So the analysis proved my guess, tweets which have more retweets generally have more favorite."
